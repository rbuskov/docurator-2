# Slice 003: See my emails listed

**Status:** ready

## Observable result

I can navigate to an "Inbox" page, pick any one of my connected Gmail accounts from a dropdown, and see real Subject + Sender + Date for the most recent 50 messages in that account, fetched live from Gmail with no local persistence.

## Prerequisites (Consumes)

- **DB tables / columns:**
  - `accounts` table (Slice 002)
- **Migrations:**
  - `0001_create_accounts.sql` (Slice 002)
- **API endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/accounts` (Slice 002) — drives the account picker
- **UI views / components:**
  - `Dashboard.tsx` at `/` (Slice 002) — this slice introduces navigation between it and a new Inbox view
- **Background jobs / orchestrators:** —
- **Env vars / configuration:**
  - `APP_PORT` (Slice 001)
  - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (Slice 002)
- **Files / modules:**

  - `src/client/main.tsx`, `src/client/App.tsx`, `src/client/api.ts` (Slices 001/002)
- **External services:**
  - Google OAuth + Gmail API access for each connected account (Slice 002 produced the tokens; this slice is the first to make Gmail API calls)
- **Other:** —

## Deliverables (Produces)

- **DB tables / columns:** —
- **Migrations:** —
- **API endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/accounts/:id/messages?limit=50` → response `{ messages: Array<{ id: string, thread_id: string, subject: string, from: string, date: string, internal_date: string }> }`. Calls `users.messages.list` with `maxResults=limit` and the account's tokens, then `users.messages.get` with `format=metadata` and `metadataHeaders=['Subject','From','Date']` for each id, returning the parsed header values plus Gmail's `internalDate` (epoch ms as string). On token refresh failure for the named account, returns HTTP 401 with `{ error: 'needs_reauth', account_id }` and the slice-002 session helper has already flipped that account's `status` to `needs_reauth`. On any other Gmail API error, returns HTTP 502 with `{ error: 'gmail_error', message }`.
- **UI views / components:**
  - `Inbox.tsx` — at route `/inbox`. Shows the account picker (defaults to the first account in `GET /api/accounts`, persisted to `localStorage` as the most recently used selection), then a table of 50 rows with columns Subject, Sender, Date. Loading state while fetching, empty state when no accounts are connected, error state when the chosen account returns `needs_reauth` (links back to the Dashboard's Reconnect button) or `gmail_error`.
  - `AccountPicker.tsx` — reusable dropdown driven by `GET /api/accounts`. Filters out accounts whose `status !== 'connected'`. Used by the Inbox view here and intended to be reused by future slices.
  - `Nav.tsx` — top-of-page nav with links to `/` (Dashboard) and `/inbox` (Inbox), rendered by `App.tsx`.
- **Background jobs / orchestrators:** —
- **Env vars / configuration:** —
- **Files / modules:**
  - `src/server/gmail/client.ts` — exports `createGmailClient(account_id: number)` that uses `session.withFreshTokens(account_id, …)` (from Slice 002) to obtain a current `OAuth2Client` and constructs `google.gmail({ version: 'v1', auth })`. Exposes only `listMessages({ maxResults, q?, pageToken? })` and `getMessage(id, { format, metadataHeaders? })`. **No write methods, no labels, no threads write, no drafts.**
  - `src/server/api/messages.ts` — registers `GET /api/accounts/:id/messages`
  - `src/client/views/Inbox.tsx`, `src/client/components/AccountPicker.tsx`, `src/client/components/Nav.tsx`
  - `src/client/router.tsx` — minimal client-side routing (React Router v6) wiring `/` → `Dashboard`, `/inbox` → `Inbox`. Used from `App.tsx`.
  - `scripts/check-gmail-readonly.ts` — node script (run via `tsx`) that walks `src/`, fails with a non-zero exit code if any file matches one of these literal substrings: `messages.modify`, `messages.trash`, `messages.delete`, `messages.send`, `messages.insert`, `messages.import`, `labels.create`, `labels.delete`, `labels.update`, `labels.patch`, `drafts.create`, `drafts.update`, `drafts.delete`, `drafts.send`, `threads.modify`, `threads.trash`, `threads.delete`, `gmail.modify`, `gmail.send`, `gmail.compose`, `gmail.insert`, `gmail.metadata`, `gmail.labels`, `gmail.settings.basic`, `gmail.settings.sharing`. The script itself is exempt from its own scan (it lists the strings as data); the exemption is implemented by ignoring the file path `scripts/check-gmail-readonly.ts`. Specs and Markdown under `docs/` are also exempt by directory.
  - `package.json` updates:
    - Adds `googleapis` to runtime deps (the `google-auth-library` from Slice 002 is already a transitive dep but is now a direct dep)
    - Adds `react-router-dom` to runtime deps
    - Adds `tsx` to dev deps (used by the build-time check)
    - Adds scripts: `"check:gmail-readonly": "tsx scripts/check-gmail-readonly.ts"`, and updates `"build"` to run `"npm run check:gmail-readonly && <existing build chain>"` so the check fails the build
- **External services:**
  - Live Gmail API calls (`users.messages.list`, `users.messages.get` with `format=metadata`) per selected account, scoped to that account's `gmail.readonly` tokens
- **Other:**
  - Build-time enforcement of "no Gmail write API references in src/", running on every `npm run build` and therefore every `docker compose up --build`

## Out of scope

- Persisting any of the fetched messages → Slice 006
- Classification of these messages → Slice 005
- Attachment fetching, body fetching, HTML→text or HTML→PDF rendering → Slices 005 / 006
- Pagination beyond the first 50 messages → Slice 006 (where full sync arrives)
- Multi-account aggregate inbox (showing messages from all accounts in one list) → not planned for v1; the Audit view in Slice 010 is the cross-account surface
- Filtering, sorting, search → Slices 010 / 011
- Inline classification action ("Classify this" button) → Slice 005 (which augments this view with the button)
- Replacement of this read-through view with a DB-backed Inbox → Slice 006

## Detailed design

This slice realizes the Gmail-side half of `architecture.md` § "Privacy model" and § "Read-only Gmail access" for the first time: a real call to Google's servers using a connected account's `gmail.readonly` tokens. It also stands up the build-time guard from `architecture.md` § "Security notes — CI enforcement". The intent of the slice (per `initial-feature-slices.md`'s note) is to prove the Gmail integration works per account and to discover API quirks early; its Inbox view is intentionally throwaway-friendly and gets replaced by Slice 006's persisted view.

- **Gmail client wrapper.** Thin layer over `googleapis`. Constructed per-call (not cached) via `session.withFreshTokens`, so each call uses currently-valid tokens for that account and refresh-on-401 already runs through the Slice 002 helper. The wrapper deliberately exposes only two methods (`listMessages`, `getMessage`); future slices that need attachments, history, or threads will add explicit methods (still read-only). Limiting the surface is what the build-time check enforces.
- **Why `format=metadata` for `getMessage`.** Headers-only is what this slice needs and is the cheapest option (no body, no attachments, no payload tree to parse). It also avoids ever pulling email content into memory in a slice that's not allowed to persist anything — a small architectural belt to go with the suspenders.
- **Date display.** Show Gmail's `Date` header verbatim (it's already an RFC 2822 string the user sees in their email client); don't reformat. `internalDate` is included in the API response for any future slice that needs a sortable timestamp.
- **Sender display.** Show the `From` header verbatim (e.g. `"Stripe <receipts@stripe.com>"`). Pretty-printing into name + email columns is polish.
- **Account picker behavior.** Defaults to the most recently used account, falling back to the first `connected` account in `GET /api/accounts`. The "most recently used" selection is stored under `localStorage['docurator.lastInboxAccountId']`. Accounts in `needs_reauth` status appear in the dropdown but are visually disabled with a "Reconnect on Dashboard" hint — selecting one is impossible, since the Inbox can only render messages from a `connected` account.
- **Routing.** React Router v6 with `BrowserRouter`. Two routes for now (`/` and `/inbox`). The `Nav` component is rendered above the route outlet so it appears on every view. Slice 002's Dashboard continues to live at `/`; this slice does not change Dashboard behavior, only adds the nav links to and from it.
- **Build-time check.** Implemented as a Node script run from `package.json`. The Dockerfile from Slice 001 already runs `npm run build` in its build stage, so the check is enforced on every image build without further Dockerfile changes. The script's match list is duplicated (deliberately) from the comments above so that adding a new forbidden pattern is a one-place edit. `architecture.md` § "Security notes" calls this out as the canonical enforcement; this slice ships it.
- **Error model.** Per-account isolation matters even in this read-only slice. A 401 from the Gmail API for one account flips that account to `needs_reauth` (via the existing Slice 002 helper) and surfaces a UI hint; the picker still works for the other accounts. Other Gmail errors (rate limit, transient 5xx) are returned as `gmail_error` and the user can retry by re-selecting the account.
- **No DB writes.** This slice's API handler does not write to SQLite. The accounts repo is read-only from this slice's perspective (the `last_seen_at` touch on successful Gmail use is deferred to Slice 006, where it lives alongside the rest of the sync orchestrator's bookkeeping).

## Acceptance criteria

- With at least one Gmail account connected from Slice 002, navigating to `/inbox` shows the Inbox view with the account picker pre-populated to the first connected account and a table of up to 50 message rows.
- Each row shows the message's `Subject` header, `From` header, and `Date` header, all matching what the same message displays in Gmail's web UI for that account.
- Switching the account picker to a different connected account reloads the table to show that account's most recent messages, with no leakage of the previous account's messages.
- An account in `needs_reauth` appears in the picker as visually disabled and cannot be selected.
- If a previously `connected` account's refresh token is revoked in Google's settings, the next request from `/inbox` for that account flips it to `needs_reauth` (visible on the Dashboard) and the Inbox shows the error state, while other accounts continue to work.
- No row is written to any SQLite table during the Inbox flow (the only writes during the slice are still those produced by Slice 002's OAuth flow).
- `npm run build` (and therefore `docker compose up --build`) fails with a non-zero exit code if any file under `src/` contains one of the forbidden Gmail-write substrings; the build passes when none of them do.
- Adding a deliberate `messages.modify` reference to any TypeScript file under `src/` causes the next `npm run build` to fail with a clear message naming the file and the offending substring.
- The codebase contains zero references to OAuth scopes other than `gmail.readonly`, `userinfo.email`, and `openid` (the latter two pulled in by Slice 002's consent flow).

## Implementation notes

- **N+1 fetch pattern.** `users.messages.list` returns just `id` and `threadId`; getting headers requires one `users.messages.get` per message. For 50 messages this is 51 sequential round-trips, which is acceptable for this throwaway slice. Slice 006's sync orchestrator handles concurrency and incremental fetches.
- **`format=metadata` and scopes.** `gmail.readonly` covers metadata fetches; this slice uses `format=metadata` with explicit `metadataHeaders=['Subject','From','Date']` and does not request the `gmail.metadata` scope (which the build-time check forbids).
- **React Router v6.** Routing uses `react-router-dom` v6 with `BrowserRouter`. Wiring is contained to `src/client/router.tsx` and `App.tsx`, keeping any future router swap a localized change.
- **Build-time check granularity.** The script uses substring matching, not AST analysis. Files under `docs/` and the script itself are exempt; nothing else in `src/` is expected to reference these substrings, even in comments. False positives are addressed by fixing the comment, not loosening the check.
- **Slice supersession.** Slice 006 reshapes `Inbox.tsx` to read from SQLite instead of Gmail directly. The Gmail client wrapper, the build-time check, and the messages API endpoint persist; only the Inbox view's data source changes.
- **`localStorage`-backed picker selection.** "Last used account" is persisted client-side as the chosen account id (no email content). If browser storage is wiped, the picker falls back to the first `connected` account.
